    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We're a group of students based on the Royal Technical 
    University (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. After observing the
    hassle of many trading sites where you have to register and
    enter a lot of data to sell or buy your stuff, we decided to
    create a simple trading site to allow people to sell and buy
    items fast and easily.</p>
    <p>If you have any suggerences or complaints, or just want to buy us 
    some good beers, please 
    <a href="mailto:contact@simpletrade.com">contact us.</a></p>
